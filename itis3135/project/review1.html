            <h3><b>Design:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Contrast/font sizing</b>: The contrast and font sizing seem sufficient for readability</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Site colors/fonts using standard .css file</b>: A brand logo is visible, I think it would be cool if it also appeared as the icon for the website. The logo is an odd shade of gray that isn’t seen in the other parts of the page the font in the logo is never seen elsewhere.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>CRAP:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Contrast</b>: The contrast between text and background is good, making it easy to read.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Repetition</b>: Repetition of design elements seems minimal but consistent.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Alignment</b>: Elements appear to be aligned properly only thing is the images used as the icons in the “contact” section have more spacing visually than any other images on the page.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Proximity</b>: Related elements are appropriately grouped together.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>Page Structure:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Header/Main/Footer</b>: The page structure includes a header, main, and footer.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Header</b>: The header includes the site/brand header in an h1 tag. The page name is not included in the header.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Main</b>: The main section starts with the name of the page as an h2.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Footer</b>: The footer includes a menu for the user's pages but the style of the footer doesn’t match that of the header. The header has an outline that separates it from the content of the page but the footer doesn’t have an outline which makes it seem unlike the rest. Also I'm unsure why you have your certifications in the footer because this website is for the client so why does it have your information? I think all that is needed is that the website was created by your firm.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><b>Other Requirements:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Brand tagline</b>: Branding is visible in the landing page withe the name centered and in big lettering to distinguish itself from the restof the page.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>HTML/CSS validation</b>: Buttons/links for HTML and CSS validation are present on the page and they also work.</p></li>
            </ul>
