        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>Design:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Contrast/font sizing</b>: The contrast between text and background is adequate, ensuring readability. However, font sizing could be improved in skills sections to enhance readability, particularly for smaller screens or users with visual impairments. The text specifcally in the header is too light.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Site colors/fonts using standard .css file</b>: css file looks consistent and grouped together.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>CRAP:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Contrast</b>: The contrast between text and background is adequate, ensuring readability. However, font sizing could be improved in skills sections to enhance readability, particularly for smaller screens or users with visual impairments. I see this in the "skills" section.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Repetition</b>: Design elements are consistent throughout the site, which is good for creating a cohesive user experience. However, there could be more repetition of certain visual elements to strengthen the site's branding and identity with the styling of the iconography being in other places besides just the header.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Alignment</b>: Elements are aligned properly, contributing to a clean and organized layout. However, there are a few instances where alignment could be adjusted slightly for better visual balance specifically in the “skills” section because it’s all horizontally placed with no spacing on the sides. The resume in that same section is also too small to read so laying them out vertically would be preferred.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Proximity</b>: Related elements are grouped together logically, making it easy for users to understand the relationships between different pieces of content. However, in the bullets for the "skills" sections, tighter proximity between related elements could further improve clarity and organization.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>Page Structure:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Header/Main/Footer</b>: The page structure includes a header, main content area, and footer, which is a standard and effective layout for websites.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Header</b>: The header contains the site/brand name in an h1 tag, which is good for establishing the site's identity. However, it could benefit from additional elements such as a navigation menu or brand slogan to enhance usability and branding. Also there is a lack of spacing in the header with text almost being outside the navigation bar.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Main</b>: The main content area starts with the page title as an h2, which helps users understand the context of the content. However, providing more descriptive headings for subsections within the main content could improve navigation and comprehension.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Footer</b>: The footer includes a menu for the user's pages, which is helpful for site navigation. It’s simple but consistent.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h3><b>Other Requirements:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Brand tagline</b>: I am not sure how the logo correlates to Melissa because I don’t see that connection anywhere else. I like that you have it as the website icon though</p></li>
                <li><p><b>HTML/CSS validation</b>: Buttons/links for HTML and CSS validation are present on the page and they also validate properly.</p></li>
            </ul>
