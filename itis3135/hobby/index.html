                        <h3>List of Essential Tips:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Master Building:</strong> Building is a core skill in Fortnite. Practice building walls, ramps, and floors to create cover, reach high ground, and even trap opponents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Utilize the Environment:</strong> Always be aware of your surroundings. Use natural cover like trees and buildings to your advantage, and learn how to edit your builds to create unexpected angles of attack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stay Aware of the Storm:</strong> The storm circle constantly shrinks, forcing players closer together. Keep an eye on the timer and map to avoid getting caught outside the safe zone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Utilize Consumables:</strong> Healing items and shields are essential for surviving encounters. Prioritize picking up these items and using them strategically to maintain your health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen Up!:</strong> Audio cues are crucial in Fortnite. Use headphones to pinpoint enemy footsteps, gunfire, and building sounds, allowing you to react accordingly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>List of Early-Game Domination Strategies:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hot Drop or Not?:</strong> Decide on your landing strategy. Hot drops offer high risk/high reward, while balanced locations provide a safer start with decent loot.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eliminate Early Threats:</strong> Don't shy away from early-game fights, especially if you have decent weapons and positioning. Eliminating opponents early reduces competition and grants valuable loot.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't Overstay Your Welcome:</strong> If you land in a hot drop location and things get hectic, don't be afraid to disengage and rotate to a less crowded area. Survival is key in the early game.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be Aware of the Third Party:</strong> Remember, the sound of gunfire attracts other players. Be cautious after eliminating someone; another player might be waiting to eliminate the victor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be Mindful of the First Storm Circle:</strong> Plan your initial rotation towards the first safe zone. Don't get caught in the storm while looting or get into unnecessary fights far from the circle.</li>
                        </ul>
